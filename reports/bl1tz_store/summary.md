### Notes & limitations

- Correlation is heuristic: an absence of correlation does NOT mean unrelated; it often means scanners report different facets (web symptom vs package CVE).
- CVSS values are taken from the scanner output (Trivy). If missing, consult authoritative NVD/GHSA pages.
- False positives are possible (especially for passive/info findings). Verify manually before remediating.
